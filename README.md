firefly-iii
===========

Firefly Mark III is a new version of Firefly built upon best practices and lessons learned 
from building Firefly. It's Mark III since the original Firefly never made it outside of my
laptop.

### Changes

Firefly III will feature:

- Double-entry bookkeeping system;
- Better budgeting tools;
- Better financial reporting;
- More control over other resources outside of personal finance
  - Accounts shared with a partner (household accounts)
  - Debts
  - Credit cards
- More robust code base (mainly for my own peace of mind);
- More test-coverage (aka: actual test coverage);
